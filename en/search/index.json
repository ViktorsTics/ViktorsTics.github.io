[{"content":" The national anthem of Latvia, \u0026ldquo;Dievs, svētī Latviju!\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;God Bless Latvia!\u0026rdquo;) (1872), is a song by Kārlis Baumanis with lyrics written by him.

It was created in the 19th century, based on the description of the ancient Lettish or Latgalian flag in the Chronicle of Events, making it one of the oldest national flags still in use today.\nThe unique carmine color of the flag was first officially described in a government document in 1922 to distinguish it from the similarly colored Austrian national flag.\nAfter the occupation of Latvia in 1940, using or storing this flag was punishable by law. The flag re-emerged publicly in the late 1980s, widely used during the Awakening, and its status as the national flag was restored on February 27, 1990.\nBackground and Interpretation The two carmine red stripes symbolize the blood shed by Latvian soldiers over centuries for the freedom of their nation. The white stripe in the middle represents the honor, justice, and dignity of the Latvians, as well as their rights and laws. The symbol of the Latvian state has a rich history, known for almost 800 years. The earliest written evidence of it dates back to the 13th century. The flag is mentioned in the Livonian Chronicle of Events as one of the flags of the Baltic peoples.\nAccording to legend, in one of the fierce battles, a Latvian commander was severely wounded and bled profusely. He was carried off the battlefield on a white cloth that became stained red with his blood. Only the middle stripe remained white, where the commander lay, who later died from his injuries. The soldiers, enraged by their loss, sought to avenge their leader\u0026rsquo;s death. They raised this cloth as a flag and, with renewed strength, went into battle, where they achieved victory. Since then, the red-white-red flag has been regarded as a national symbol of Latvia.\nAccording to another version of the event, the blood of fallen enemies was collected in a large cauldron, where a white cloth tied to a spear was dipped. Thus, the entire cloth was stained blood-red, except for the spot where it was attached. This flag was used to intimidate opponents during battles.\nIn 1870, Latvian students found a description of the red-white-red flag in ancient chronicles and decided to adopt it as a national symbol.\nThe first Latvian national flag made of fabric was created by a simple teacher, Jānis Lapiņš. The sketch of the flag came to him along with thoughts about Latvian independence. The flag itself was sewn by Jānis’s bride, Marianna Straumane, in 1916.\nThe Cēsis History and Art Museum has preserved the first version of the flag. Its selection was not accidental. First, Cēsis is Jānis’s hometown. Second, the Livonian Chronicle of Events from 1279 states that soldiers with the red-white-red flag came from Cēsis.\nIn various regions of Latvia, Jānis’s flag underwent changes:\nimages of a heart pierced by a sword were added, along with various ornaments; the number and width of the white stripes were altered; other shades of red were used. However, it was the first version of the flag that was preserved and widely adopted.\n","date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/p/karogs/Flag_of_Latvia.svg","permalink":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/en/p/flag/","title":"Flag"},{"content":" Latvia is one of the most forested countries in Europe. Forests cover 53% of the country’s territory, which is twice as much as in 1923. The main tree species are conifers, such as pine and spruce, which account for 55% of forested areas. Latvia continues to increase its forested areas, partly thanks to the natural overgrowth of agricultural land.\nAS “Latvijas Valsts Meži” (LVM), a state-owned company that manages 1.6 million hectares of forest land, plays a key role in forest resource management. Thousands of hectares of forests are restored annually, which not only maintains ecological balance but also supports the country’s economic growth through forest resource exports. On average, only 69% of the annual growth is harvested, so economically accessible forest resources in Latvia are increasing. This is an important part of the Latvian economy, providing jobs and revenue from timber sales in both domestic and international markets.\nIn 2018, state forests were restored over an area of 8,800 hectares, with 24.5 million new trees planted, or more than 12 trees per resident of Latvia. In total, 15,200 hectares of state forests were restored over the year.\n","date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/en/p/forestry/","title":"Forestry"},{"content":"\nValstspilsētas City Coat of arms Statusa piešķiršanas gads Population (2024) Daugavpils 1940 77 799 Jēkabpils 2009 21 150 Jelgava 1940 54 701 Jūrmala 1959 52 154 Liepāja 1940 66 680 Ogre 2021 22 767 Rēzekne 1952 26 131 Rīga 1931 605 273 Valmiera 2009 22 376 Ventspils 1940 32 634 Term Explanations Novads – a large administrative division in Latvia, similar to provinces or regions in other countries. Novadi include several cities and parishes (pagasti), as well as smaller settlements. Example: Kuldīgas novads includes the city of Kuldīga and the town of Skrunda, along with Alsunga parish (pagasts), where one can find Alsunga (center) and Reģi (village).\nPagasts – an administrative unit below the level of novads that typically includes rural areas or small settlements. Pagasts is similar to municipal districts or rural counties in other countries.\nPilsēta – an independent administrative unit, which can either be part of a novads or function as a separate administrative entity. Major cities, such as Riga or Liepaja, have their own administrative status.\nPilsētas novads – a district that includes both urban and suburban areas. Such districts consist of a large city and its surrounding territories.\nMunicipalities Municipality Ģerbonis Towns Population (2024) Ādažu Ādaži\n23 281 Aizkraukles Aizkraukle\nJaunjelgava\nKoknese\nPļaviņas\n28 618 Alūksnes Alūksne 13 059 Augšdaugavas Daugavpils\nIlūkste\nSubate\n24 361 Balvu Balvi Viļaka\n17 910 Bauskas Bauska Iecava\n40 906 Cēsu Cēsis\nLīgatne 40 943 Dienvidkurzemes Grobiņa\nAizpute\nDurbe\nPāvilosta\nPriekule 32 708 Dobeles Dobele\nAuce 27 474 Gulbenes Gulbene 18 740 Jēkabpils Jēkabpils\nAknīste\nViesīte\n39 276 Jelgavas Jelgava 32 053 Krāslavas Krāslava\nDagda 19 833 Kuldīgas Kuldīga\nSkrunda 26 956 Ķekavas Ķekava\nBaldone\nBaloži\n31 303 Limbažu Limbaži\nAinaži\nAloja\nLimbaži\nSalacgrīva\nStaicele 27 852 Līvānu Līvāni 10 215 Ludzas Ludza\nKārsava\nZilupe 20 745 Madonas Madona\nCesvaine\nLubāna 27 255 Mārupes Mārupe 37 025 Ogres Ogre\nIkšķile\nĶegums\nLielvārde 57 689 Olaines Olaine 20 658 Preiļu Preiļi 15 768 Rēzeknes Rēzekne\nViļāni 28 305 Ropažu Ulbroka\nVangaži 35 178 Salaspils Salaspils 23 694 Saldus Saldus\nBrocēni 26 320 Saulkrastu Saulkrasti 9926 Siguldas Sigulda\n31 469 Smiltenes Smiltene\nApe 17 697 Talsu Talsi\nSabile\nStende\nValdemārpils 34 675 Tukuma Tukums\nKandava 43 641 Valkas Valka 7501 Valmieras Valmiera\nMazsalaca\nRūjiena\nSeda\nStrenči 50 283 Varakļānu Varakļāni\n2890 Ventspils Ventspils\nPiltene 10 303 Historical lands Municipality Coat of arms Flag Kurzeme none Latgale Sēlija Vidzeme none Zemgale ","date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/p/administrat%C4%ABvais-iedal%C4%ABjums/previewadm_hu17931509079531829812.jpg","permalink":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/en/p/administrative-divisions/","title":"Administrative divisions"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/en/p/","title":""},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ViktorsTics.github.io/en/p/","title":""}]
